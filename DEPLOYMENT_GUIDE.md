âœ… **It's fast and reliable**
âœ… **You don't need to keep your computer on**

## Understanding the Cloud Files I Created

### `Dockerfile` - Like a Recipe
- Tells the cloud how to build your website
- Like giving someone instructions to cook your recipe

### `docker-compose.yml` - Like a Kitchen Setup
- Sets up everything needed to run your website
- Database, monitoring, etc.

### `vercel.json` - Vercel Instructions
- Tells Vercel how to deploy your React app
- Handles routing and environment variables

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automatic Updates
- When you push code to GitHub, it automatically:
  - Tests your code
  - Builds your website
  - Deploys it to the cloud

## Why Use Cloud Instead of Your Computer?

| Your Computer | Cloud |
|---------------|-------|
| Only works when your computer is on | Always on |
| Only you can access it | Anyone can access it |
| You have to manually update | Updates automatically |
| Can crash or break | Very reliable |
| Limited to your internet speed | Fast worldwide |

## Next Steps (When You're Ready)

1. **Start with Vercel** - Get your website online first
2. **Learn about environment variables** - How to keep secrets safe
3. **Set up automatic deployments** - Connect to GitHub
4. **Add monitoring** - See how many people visit your site
5. **Learn about databases** - Supabase is already set up!
