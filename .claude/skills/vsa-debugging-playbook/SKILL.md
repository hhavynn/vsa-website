# VSA Debugging Playbook

**What this skill is for.** You have a symptom, not a diagnosis. This playbook maps each of this project's real failure modes to a first check (exact command), ranked likely causes, a discriminating experiment, and where to go for the fix. It exists because several of this project's failure modes look identical on the surface (empty rows vs. denied rows; degraded mode vs. bad query; the two parallel points systems) and picking the wrong branch has historically cost hours.

**When NOT to use this skill:**

| If you need… | Go to |
|---|---|
| Full incident narratives (root cause, evidence, commits) | `vsa-failure-archaeology` |
| Whether a change is even allowed / how to get it approved | `vsa-change-control` |
| RLS theory, SECURITY DEFINER, migration-authoring checklist | `vsa-supabase-security-reference` |
| Design tokens, dark mode conventions, component layering depth | `vsa-design-system-reference` |
| Setting up a dev environment from scratch | `vsa-build-and-env` |
| Deploying, applying migrations, running the image pipeline | `vsa-run-and-operate` |
| Diagnostic tooling deep-dives (verify-rls-security.mjs, audits, Lighthouse) | `vsa-diagnostics-and-measurement` |
| What counts as verification evidence before you ship | `vsa-validation-and-qa` |

**Jargon, defined once:**

- **RLS** — Row Level Security: Postgres policies that filter which rows a role can see/write. A query blocked by RLS returns *empty rows*, not an error.
- **Grant** — SQL-level permission (`GRANT SELECT ON …`) that a role needs before RLS is even evaluated. A missing grant returns `permission denied` (code `42501`).
- **Degraded mode** — the app's designed behavior when Supabase is unreachable or over quota: public pages render static fallback content instead of crashing (see `AGENTS.md` "Degraded mode").
- **Egress** — bandwidth billed when data (mostly images) is served *out* of Supabase Storage. This project had a real egress crisis; see traps below.
- **SECURITY DEFINER** — a Postgres function that runs with its owner's privileges, bypassing the caller's RLS. Used deliberately in `is_admin_user()`; dangerous when accidental (views).
- **CRA** — Create React App (react-scripts 5). This project is CRA, not Vite/Next; jest and build behavior follow CRA rules.

## Symptom → triage table

Commands run from the repo root. Commands marked **[live creds]** need `.env.local` populated or Supabase dashboard access — everything else is repo-local and safe.

| Symptom | First check (exact command) | Likely causes, ranked | Discriminating experiment | Fix route |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Page renders fallback content, `ContentUnavailableState`, or `DegradedModeBanner` | `grep -c "REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL\|REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" .env.local` (expect 2) | 1. Missing/wrong env vars (client never connects) 2. Supabase outage or quota exhaustion 3. A caught error that `isSupabaseUnavailable()` classifies as an outage | Read `src/utils/isSupabaseUnavailable.ts` (L9): it returns true for HTTP 429/402/503/504, any `TypeError` (network/CORS), and message fragments like `quota`, `egress`, `bandwidth`, `fetch failed`. Check the browser console for the raw error, then check https://status.supabase.com. If env vars are present and Supabase is up, the error is being *misclassified* — inspect the actual thrown error's status/message. | Env setup → `vsa-build-and-env`. Real outage/quota → `vsa-run-and-operate`. Fallback content itself lives in `src/config/publicFallbackContent.ts` (playbook agent: `vsa-public-content`). |
| Query returns **empty rows, no error** | Confirm it's not degraded mode first (row above), then run Experiment A below | 1. RLS policy filters out the rows for this role 2. The data genuinely isn't there (wrong filter, wrong table — see dual points row) 3. Querying a view whose underlying join drops rows | Experiment A (RLS vs. grant vs. no-data), below the table | RLS policy details → `vsa-supabase-security-reference`; schema truth is `supabase/migrations/` |
| Query errors with **"permission denied"** (`42501`) | Same Experiment A | 1. Missing `GRANT` for `anon`/`authenticated` on a new table/view/function 2. Grants revoked but re-grant forgotten (revoke-then-grant pattern half-applied) | Experiment A: `permission denied` = grants problem; `[]` = RLS problem. These are different fixes — don't "fix" RLS when the grant is missing | `vsa-supabase-security-reference` (owns the grant/revoke patterns and migration checklist) |
| Points or attendance change **not visible in UI** | `grep -rn "member_event_attendance\|member_yearly_points\|event_attendance\|user_points" src/data/repos/*.ts` | 1. You wrote to one points system, the UI reads the other (see Experiment B) 2. Event missing `academic_term_id` → excluded from yearly totals 3. Stale react-query cache (next row) | Experiment B (dual points systems), below the table | Protected domain — do NOT modify points/leaderboard logic without explicit request (`AGENTS.md` "Things to never do"). Audit via playbook agent `vsa-points-attendance-guardian`. Architecture rationale → `vsa-architecture-contract` |
| Event's points appear in All-Time but **missing from a yearly leaderboard** | **[live creds]** SQL editor: `select id, title, academic_term_id from events where academic_term_id is null;` | 1. Event has no `academic_term_id` (documented hard requirement — `docs/leaderboard-system.md`: "Events MUST have an academic_term_id assigned to be counted in yearly totals") | Assign the term in Admin → Events, re-check the `member_yearly_points` view | `vsa-points-attendance-guardian` for anything beyond assigning the term |
| **Stale data after a mutation** (create/edit succeeds, list doesn't update) | `grep -rn "invalidateQueries" src/hooks/useEvents.ts src/hooks/usePoints.ts` | 1. Mutation's `onSuccess` doesn't invalidate the query key the list reads 2. Query key mismatch (`['events']` vs `'event-stats'` — both styles exist) 3. You bypassed the repo/hook layer | Working examples: `src/hooks/useEvents.ts` L86–133 — e.g. check-in invalidates `['event', id]`, `['events']`, `['user-points']`, `['leaderboard']` in one `onSuccess`. Compare your mutation against these. This is react-query **v3** (`react-query@3.39.3` in package.json), not @tanstack v4/v5 — v5 idioms from training data may not apply | Pattern home → `vsa-architecture-contract` |
| Test fails: `Cannot use import statement outside a module` / SyntaxError inside `node_modules/zod` or `@hookform/resolvers` | `grep -n "transformIgnorePatterns" package.json` | 1. A new ESM-only dependency isn't in the jest `transformIgnorePatterns` allowlist (currently `node_modules/(?!(zod\|@hookform/resolvers)/)`) | Add the failing package name inside the `(?!(…))` group in `package.json` → `jest` and re-run. See trap 4 below | `vsa-build-and-env` (owns setup traps); tests → playbook agent `vsa-testing-qa` |
| `npm test` hangs / CI never finishes | Use `CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false` | 1. CRA jest defaults to watch mode; without `CI=true … --watchAll=false` it waits for input forever | n/a | `vsa-validation-and-qa` (owns the verification command set) |
| Console warnings during tests (jsdom, ThemeProvider, Framer Motion) | Check the exit code, not the noise: `CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false; echo "exit=$?"` | 1. Known-acceptable warnings — `AGENTS.md` (Testing): "Existing jsdom, ThemeProvider, and Framer Motion console warnings are acceptable when the test command exits successfully" | If exit code is 0, ship. If non-zero, read the first *failure*, not the first warning | `vsa-validation-and-qa` |
| Build fails on TypeScript syntax that "should work" | `grep '"typescript"' package.json` | 1. This repo is TypeScript **4.9.5** — `satisfies` works (4.9+) but `const` type parameters, 5.x decorator syntax, etc. do not 2. Strict mode violation (`any` is banned; use `unknown` + narrowing per AGENTS.md) | Check the TS version before assuming the code is wrong | `vsa-build-and-env` |
| `deno check` on an Edge Function shows ~a dozen type errors | `deno check supabase/functions/vsa-ai-assistant/index.ts` | 1. **Pre-existing esm.sh type-resolution noise, not your regression** — verified 2026-07-06: exactly `Found 12 errors.` on an untouched checkout | Run `deno check` on the *unmodified* function first (e.g. `git stash` your edits mentally — read the file from HEAD via `git show HEAD:supabase/functions/vsa-ai-assistant/index.ts`) and diff the error *count and locations* against your edited version. New errors at your lines = yours; the baseline 12 = noise. See trap 5 | Edge Function deploy/ops → `vsa-run-and-operate`; Ask VSA behavior → playbook agent `vsa-ai-knowledge` |
| Edge Function returns 500 in production | **[live creds]** Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → *function* → Logs (functions: `analytics-proxy`, `secure-ai`, `trigger-event-image-migration`, `trigger-house-event-image-migration`, `vsa-ai-assistant` — verify with `ls supabase/functions/`) | 1. Missing function secret 2. Runtime error visible only in logs 3. Schema drift between function SQL and applied migrations | Reproduce with a curl against the function URL and compare the logged error to local `deno check` output | Secrets catalog → `vsa-config-and-flags`; deploy order → `vsa-run-and-operate` |
| Wrong colors / dark mode broken on one component | `grep -rn "text-gray-\|bg-white\|bg-gray-900" src/path/to/component` | 1. Hardcoded palette classes instead of semantic tokens — `tailwind.config.js` defines `surface`, `surface2`, `text-primary` as CSS-variable-driven tokens; hardcoded grays don't flip with theme 2. Class strings concatenated raw instead of via `cn()` (`src/lib/utils.ts`) 3. Missing `dark:` variant where tokens are insufficient | Toggle theme: dark mode is class-based (`darkMode: 'class'` in tailwind.config.js; `ThemeContext` sets the class on `<html>`). If the element doesn't change on toggle, it's hardcoded | `vsa-design-system-reference` for token depth; `AGENTS.md` bans hardcoded color classes |
| Logged-in user not recognized as **admin** | `cat src/hooks/useAdmin.ts` — it selects `is_admin` from `user_profiles` where `id = user.id` | 1. `user_profiles.is_admin` is false/missing for that user **[live creds]** 2. The query errors and `useAdmin` **fails closed** — its catch sets `isAdmin=false` and only `console.error`s, so an RLS/grant problem *looks like* "not an admin" 3. RLS recursion regression on `user_profiles` (see trap 1) | Open the browser console: `Error checking admin status:` present = cause 2/3 (data-access problem), absent = cause 1 (data problem). For cause 3, the fix shape is the `is_admin_user()` SECURITY DEFINER helper in `supabase/migrations/20260620020000_fix_user_profiles_rls_recursion.sql` | `vsa-supabase-security-reference`; full incident → `vsa-failure-archaeology` (#160) |
| A **new view** returns data to `anon` unexpectedly, or is writable | `grep -n "revoke all" supabase/migrations/<your_migration>.sql` (expect a revoke before any grant) | 1. Default-privileges gotcha: this project's `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` grants ALL on new relations *including views* to anon/authenticated, and definer-owned simple views are auto-updatable — writes pass through, bypassing base-table RLS | Model migration: `supabase/migrations/20260701000000_add_member_photo_requests.sql` L235–260 — comment reads "Revoke everything, then grant SELECT only." Every new view needs `revoke all … from anon, authenticated;` then an explicit `grant select` | `vsa-supabase-security-reference` (owns the full pattern) |
| Images broken or page **slow with heavy image traffic** | Inspect the failing URL in devtools Network tab: does the host contain `supabase.co/storage`? | 1. Image still served from Supabase Storage instead of `/public` (egress trap — see trap 2) 2. Migrated path wrong/missing in `/public` 3. Storage object actually deleted (should never happen — deletion is banned in AGENTS.md) | `npm run migrate:images:dry` reports what the image-migration pipeline (`scripts/migrate-supabase-images-to-public.ts`) would move — dry-run only, safe. Compare its report to the broken URL | Pipeline operation → `vsa-run-and-operate`; audits → playbook agent `vsa-storage-egress` |
| Graphify gives answers that don't match the code | `grep -n "Built from commit" graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md && git rev-parse --short HEAD` | 1. Stale graph — the two hashes differ (e.g. report says `a3d7ea60` while HEAD is newer) 2. Git hooks not installed | `./scripts/graphify-run hook status` — expect `post-commit: installed` and `post-checkout: installed`. Refresh with `graphify . --update` (interactive sessions only; never inside a feature PR) | Graphify workflow → `docs/graphify-workflow.md` and the `graphify` skill |

## Discriminating experiments

### Experiment A — empty rows vs. permission denied vs. no data

These three look similar from the UI (something doesn't show up) but have disjoint fixes. RLS filtering silently returns `[]`; a missing grant raises `permission denied`; absent data is neither's fault.

1. **[live creds]** In the Supabase SQL editor (runs as a privileged role, bypasses RLS):

   ```sql
   select count(*) from <table_or_view>;  -- ground truth: does the data exist at all?
   ```

   Count is 0 → **no data**: the write never landed (check Experiment B if points-related) or your filter is wrong. Stop here.

2. **[live creds]** Same query as the `anon` role via REST, from your shell (reads keys from `.env.local`):

   ```bash
   set -a; source .env.local; set +a
   curl -s "$REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/<table_or_view>?select=*&limit=3" \
     -H "apikey: $REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
   ```

   - `[]` (empty array, HTTP 200) → **RLS is filtering**. The role has permission to query but no policy admits these rows. Fix the policy (via `vsa-supabase-security-reference` patterns), never by weakening RLS broadly (banned in `AGENTS.md`).
   - `{"code":"42501", …"permission denied"…}` → **missing grant**. RLS was never reached. Add/restore the `GRANT`.
   - Rows returned → the backend is fine for `anon`; if the app still shows nothing, the bug is client-side: wrong repo method, wrong query key, or an `authenticated`-role policy difference (repeat with a logged-in user's JWT as the Bearer token).

3. To test the `authenticated` role specifically, replace the Bearer token with a real session JWT (copy from devtools → Application → Local Storage → the `sb-*-auth-token` entry, `access_token` field). Policies frequently differ between `anon` and `authenticated`.

### Experiment B — which points system did your write land in?

There are **two parallel points systems** (documented in `docs/leaderboard-system.md`; consolidation is FUTURE work, not done):

| System | Tables | Feeds which UI | Repo/consumers (verified 2026-07-06) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Member/leaderboard system (**source of truth for public + admin leaderboards**) | `member_event_attendance` + `events` + `academic_terms`, aggregated by the `member_yearly_points` view (and `house_member_yearly_points` for Houses) | Public Leaderboard, admin Members/Points/Import, MyVSACard | `src/data/repos/leaderboard.ts` (reads `member_yearly_points`, `house_member_yearly_points`); `src/pages/Admin/{Members,Points,Import}.tsx`; `src/components/features/points/MyVSACard.tsx` |
| Authenticated check-in system | `event_attendance` + `user_points` | Logged-in member dashboard, live check-in flows | `src/data/repos/points.ts` (reads `user_points`, `event_attendance`); `src/data/repos/events.ts`; `src/hooks/useEventAttendance.ts`; `src/components/features/dashboard/MemberDashboard.tsx` |

The experiment: **[live creds]** after the write, check both sides in the SQL editor:

```sql
select count(*) from member_event_attendance where member_id = '<id>';
select count(*) from event_attendance      where user_id   = '<id>';
```

If the row is in `event_attendance` but the *leaderboard* doesn't move — that's by design; the leaderboard doesn't read that table. If it's in `member_event_attendance` but yearly totals don't move — check the event's `academic_term_id` (yearly-totals row in the triage table). Do not "fix" this by writing to both tables or altering calculation logic: points/leaderboard are protected domains (`AGENTS.md` "Things to never do"); route changes through `vsa-change-control` and audit via `vsa-points-attendance-guardian`.

## Traps that cost real time

One-paragraph versions. Full chronicles with evidence live in `vsa-failure-archaeology` — read that before touching any of these areas.

1. **`user_profiles` RLS recursion (incident #160, commit `9e0c102e`).** An RLS policy on `user_profiles` checked admin status by querying `user_profiles` — policy evaluation triggered the policy again, recursively, taking down profile reads (and with them, admin detection) in production. The fix (`supabase/migrations/20260620020000_fix_user_profiles_rls_recursion.sql`) extracts the check into `is_admin_user()`, a caller-bound `SECURITY DEFINER` SQL function with `SET search_path = ''` so policy evaluation bypasses the table's own RLS without letting callers enumerate other users' admin status. The trap for you: any policy on table T that selects from T is a recursion; the symptom is errors or hangs on reads of T, which surface in this app as "nobody is admin" because `useAdmin` fails closed. → `vsa-failure-archaeology` for the timeline; `vsa-supabase-security-reference` for the pattern.

2. **The Supabase egress crisis.** Serving event/gallery/House images straight from Supabase Storage burned through the bandwidth quota; when the quota exhausted, Supabase started failing requests and the whole site degraded — which is exactly why `isSupabaseUnavailable()` explicitly matches `quota`, `egress`, and `bandwidth` message fragments, and why the app has a designed degraded mode at all. The response was a whole pipeline (`scripts/migrate-supabase-images-to-public.ts`, `npm run migrate:images:{dry,apply}`, commits `5fa96185`, PRs #71/#72/#80, `docs/event-image-migration.md`) migrating image URLs to `/public` assets served by Vercel. The trap: any new feature that renders Supabase Storage URLs on a public page reopens the wound. Never delete the Storage originals. → operation details in `vsa-run-and-operate`; full story in `vsa-failure-archaeology`.

3. **New views are born world-writable.** This project's `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` configuration grants ALL on newly created relations — *including views* — to `anon` and `authenticated`, and Postgres makes simple definer-owned views auto-updatable, so a "read-only" view silently accepts INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE that bypass the base table's RLS. This was caught during the member-photo-requests work; the canonical fix is in `supabase/migrations/20260701000000_add_member_photo_requests.sql` (L235–260): `revoke all on <view> from anon, authenticated;` then grant exactly `select` to exactly the roles that need it, for **every** new view, every time. → mechanics and checklist in `vsa-supabase-security-reference`.

4. **Jest chokes on ESM dependencies.** CRA's jest doesn't transform `node_modules` by default, so ESM-only packages blow up with `Cannot use import statement outside a module` — hours have been lost reading that as a broken test rather than a config gap. The repo already allowlists the two known offenders in `package.json` → `jest`: `"transformIgnorePatterns": ["node_modules/(?!(zod|@hookform/resolvers)/)"]`. When you add a dependency and tests suddenly fail *inside* `node_modules/<pkg>`, append `<pkg>` inside that negative-lookahead group — don't rewrite the test. → `vsa-build-and-env` owns the full setup-traps list.

5. **`deno check` noise on `vsa-ai-assistant` is not your regression.** Type-checking the Ask VSA Edge Function on a clean checkout reports exactly `Found 12 errors.` (verified 2026-07-06, Deno from Homebrew) — all esm.sh remote-type resolution artifacts (`Type '"public"' is not assignable to type 'never'` and friends), none of them shipping-blocking since the function runs fine deployed. The trap runs both ways: don't burn an afternoon "fixing" the baseline 12, and don't let a *13th* error hide among them — always diff your error count and line numbers against the untouched baseline (`git show HEAD:supabase/functions/vsa-ai-assistant/index.ts > /tmp/base.ts && deno check /tmp/base.ts`). → `vsa-failure-archaeology`.

## Provenance and maintenance

Written 2026-07-06 against commit `368fbf63` (branch `codex/reactbits-ui`). Sources: `AGENTS.md`; `docs/leaderboard-system.md`; `package.json`; `src/utils/isSupabaseUnavailable.ts`; `src/hooks/useAdmin.ts`; `src/hooks/useEvents.ts`; `src/hooks/usePoints.ts`; `src/data/repos/{leaderboard,points}.ts`; `src/lib/supabase.ts`; `tailwind.config.js`; `src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`; `supabase/migrations/20260620020000_fix_user_profiles_rls_recursion.sql`; `supabase/migrations/20260701000000_add_member_photo_requests.sql`; live `deno check` run; `git log` (commits `9e0c102e`, `5fa96185`).

Re-verify before trusting, if this file is old:

```bash
grep -n "transformIgnorePatterns" package.json                  # jest ESM allowlist still zod + @hookform/resolvers?
grep -n '"typescript"\|"react-query"' package.json               # still TS 4.9.x / react-query v3?
grep -n "429\|quota" src/utils/isSupabaseUnavailable.ts          # degraded-mode signals unchanged?
grep -n "member_yearly_points" src/data/repos/leaderboard.ts     # leaderboard still reads the view?
grep -rn "from('user_points')" src/data/repos/points.ts | head -1  # second system still live? (consolidation was FUTURE work as of 2026-07-06)
deno check supabase/functions/vsa-ai-assistant/index.ts 2>&1 | tail -2  # baseline error count still 12?
ls supabase/functions/                                           # Edge Function inventory
grep -n "Built from commit" graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md         # graph freshness
```

If `docs/leaderboard-system.md` gains a "consolidation complete" note, Experiment B's table split is obsolete — rewrite that section before anything else.
