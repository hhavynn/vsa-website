          A game show night where we see which school in the Southern California region REALLY has the BEST VSA! Two schools at a time will participate in various party games and a row of judges (usually UCSD VSA's Alumni or special guests) will assign points to whichever team completes the objective, and Y O U get to watch.

          So, come to watch chaos and fun play out at UCSD's very own External event to see the best of every school's VSA's compete for the world-renowned WILD 'N CULTURE, GOLDEN, BELT!!!!
